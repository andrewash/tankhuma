Rabbi Barchiya in the name of Rabbi Levi<BR/>
began his homily as follows:<BR/>
&quot;You have given me the shield of your 	protection-salvation;<BR/>
Your right hand supported me,<BR/>
Your giving me the benefit of the doubt has made me 		great.&quot; (Psalms 18:36)<BR/>
When (God) revealed Himself unto (Avraham):<BR/>
there was the Holy One, Blessed Is He,<BR/>
standard while Avraham was sitting!<BR/>
As it is said:<BR/>
&quot;As he was sitting&quot; (Gen. 18:1)<BR/>
<BR/>
The Holy One, Blessed is He, said to him:<BR/>
Don't be astounded!<BR/>
For even for your children I will be doing thus.<BR/>
When they will be sitting,<BR/>
in the synagogues and study halls,<BR/>
then too I will be standing-firm beside them.<BR/>
As it is said,<BR/>
&quot;God stations himself in the congregation of God.&quot; (Psalms 82:1)<BR/>
<BR/>
It is a universal practice,<BR/>
when a student is sick,<BR/>
and the Rav goes to inquire-after-his-health,<BR/>
first his fellow students walk-as-a-throng together<BR/>
to give over the Rav's messages to the household of the sick man:<BR/>
that the Rav asks to inquire-after-his-health.<BR/>
<BR/>
However, the Holy One, Blessed is He, does not act like that!<BR/>
When Avraham was circumcised,<BR/>
and he was suffering from the circumcision,<BR/>
he assigned divine-messengers to travel to inquire-after-his-health<BR/>
Before yet the divine-messengers were walking,<BR/>
the Holy One, Blessed is He, (went OR was there) before them!<BR/>
As it is said:<BR/>
"God was revealed to him" (Gen. 18:1),<BR/>
and only then:<BR/>
"He lifted up his eyes and saw [the divine-messengers]" (Gen. 18:2)<BR/>
Is any being more humble than this?!<BR/>
<BR/>
Our Rabbis said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer ben P'dat:<BR/>
In seven passages the Holy One, Blessed Is He, placed God's self side-by-side<BR/>
with the lower creatures.<BR/>
As it is said:<BR/>
"For YHWH is your God,<BR/>
he (is) the God of gods,<BR/>
and the Lord of lords,<BR/>
The Great God! Powerful, and awe-inspiring,<BR/>
Whose face will not flinch at threats,<BR/>
nor will he take a bribe!" (Deut. 10:17)<BR/>
And what is written after this?<BR/>
He establishes the justice of orphan and widow,<BR/>
and loves the sojourner such that he gives him bread and clothing." (Psalms 138:6)<BR/>
<BR/>
Also it says:<BR/>
"Even though raised-high is YHWH,<BR/>
still the lowly will he regard-favourably." (ibid.)<BR/>
<BR/>
Also it says:<BR/>
"For thus said The Forever Exalted and Uplifted -<BR/>
and holy (is) his Name:<BR/>
High and holy I will dwell,<BR/>
Yet also with the crushed and lowly-in-spirit." (Isaiah 57:15)<BR/>
